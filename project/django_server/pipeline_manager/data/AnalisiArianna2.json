                    "abstract": "We demonstrate that stress differentially regulates glutamate homeostasis in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus and established a previously unknown role for the glial marker xCT in the homeostatic regulation of the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) in stress resilience and antidepressant responses. We provide RNAseq roadmap for the stress-sensitive vDG and show that the transcription factor REST binds to xCT promoter in co-occupancy with the epigenetic marker H3K27acet, to negatively regulate xCT expression. Reduced xCT was also observed in a genetic mouse model of inherent susceptibility to depression. Pharmacologically modulating histone acetylation with next-generation therapeutics, such as acetyl-N-cysteine (NAC) or acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC), rapidly increased xCT reduction and activated a network that included mGlu2 receptors to prime an enhanced glutamate homeostasis that promoted stress resilience and antidepressant-like responses. Moreover, pharmacological xCT blockage counteracted NAC prophylactic effects. Anatomical (vDG) and cell-type specific (GFAP+) virus-overexpression mimicked the effects of pharmacological treatments in increasing stress resilience. These findings establish xCT as critical regulator of the glutamate system in a network with mGlu2 receptors. These studies also point to a role of histone acetylation as mediator of stress resilience. Overall design: Ventral dentate gyrus RNA from 3 biological replicates per group (Not-stressed Controls or Ctrl and Chronic Restrained Stress or CRS, all male mice) was used for library prep (TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Human/Mouse/Rat) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 at the Genomic Core facility at The Rockefeller University. Each sample was provided with a unique adapter and all samples were put in the same pool and run in multiple lanes to control for lane effects with a sequencing depth of about 30M (100bp, single end).",

                    "abstract": "We demonstrate that stress differentially regulates glutamate homeostasis in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus and established a previously unknown role for the glial marker xCT in the homeostatic regulation of the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) in stress resilience and antidepressant responses. We provide RNAseq roadmap for the stress-sensitive vDG and show that the transcription factor REST binds to xCT promoter in co-occupancy with the epigenetic marker H3K27acet, to negatively regulate xCT expression. Reduced xCT was also observed in a genetic mouse model of inherent susceptibility to depression. Pharmacologically modulating histone acetylation with next-generation therapeutics, such as acetyl-N-cysteine (NAC) or acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC), rapidly increased xCT reduction and activated a network that included mGlu2 receptors to prime an enhanced glutamate homeostasis that promoted stress resilience and antidepressant-like responses. Moreover, pharmacological xCT blockage counteracted NAC prophylactic effects. Anatomical (vDG) and cell-type specific (GFAP+) virus-overexpression mimicked the effects of pharmacological treatments in increasing stress resilience. These findings establish xCT as critical regulator of the glutamate system in a network with mGlu2 receptors. These studies also point to a role of histone acetylation as mediator of stress resilience. Overall design: Ventral dentate gyrus RNA from 3 biological replicates per group (Not-stressed Controls or Ctrl and Chronic Restrained Stress or CRS, all male mice) was used for library prep (TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Human/Mouse/Rat) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 at the Genomic Core facility at The Rockefeller University. Each sample was provided with a unique adapter and all samples were put in the same pool and run in multiple lanes to control for lane effects with a sequencing depth of about 30M (100bp, single end).",

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder.

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS). Note: The raw data for Samples GSM2740709-GSM2740726, GSM2740805, and GSM2740808 were updated in January 2018. The processed data have not changed.",

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder.

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability.

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS).

                    "abstract": "Rational: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide. While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Methods: Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across 6 brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model of chronic variable stress and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Results: Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in depressed humans and in stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene DUSP6 in prefrontal cortex mimics stress susceptibility in females only by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such DUSP6 downregulation also recapitulates the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in PFC of depressed females. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal dramatic sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder. Overall design: RNA sequencing data from (1) 6 human postmortem brain regions in males and females with and without major depression and (2) 2 epuivalent brain regions in males and female mice with and without 21 days of chronic varibale stress (CVS). Note: The raw data for Samples GSM2740709-GSM2740726, GSM2740805, and GSM2740808 were updated in January 2018. The processed data have not changed.",

                    "abstract": "Objective: To elucidate the potential effects of stressful factors for depression on the hippocampal, frontal cortex and pituitary gland genome-wide transcriptomes at the molecular level, we evaluated the transcriptomic profiles of depression rats under chronic restraint stress (CRS). Methods: Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into control, model, fluoxetine and acupuncture groups. Experimental period was 28 days. Open-field test, Sucrose preference and body weight were investigated respectively at the experiment before and after the experiment. The experiment having been finished, solexa sequencing technology (Illumina Nextseq 500/151nt) was applied to investigate and verify the altered hippocampal, frontal cortex and pituitary gland  genome-wide transcriptome analysis in rats of all groups. Results: Based on the data from RNA-seq analysis, it revealed that compared the expression of genes in the control group with model group in the respective of three brain tissues, 101, 134, 148 differential expression genes were found in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and pituitary gland, respectively; compared the expression of genes in the fluoxetine group with model group in the respective of three brain tissues, 41, 46, 87 differential expression genes were found in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and pituitary gland, respectively; compared the expression of genes in the acupuncture group with model group in the respective of three brain tissues, 107, 89, 179 differential expression genes were found in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and pituitary gland, respectively. Furthermore, we used the GO (Gene ontology) analysis and KEGG (Kyo-To conservation of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis for these differentially expressed genes. We found that the results of these two analyses were consistent, both mainly related to monoamine neurotransmitters, inflammation and immune response in control group VS model group. It is noted that this phenomenon also appears in fluoxetine group compared  with model group, acupuncture group VS model group. Importantly, the antidepressant effect of acupuncture was more extensive, which was more consistent with the pathogenesis of depression induced by CRS in rats. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of the hippocampal, frontal cortex and pituitary gland  genome-wide transcriptomes in depression rats under CRS by RNA-seq technology. The results of this study revealed multiple DEGs and possible mechanisms specifying the function of hippocampal, frontal cortex and pituitary gland in depression rats induced by CRS. These results provide a basis for further investigation of the signaling mechanisms that affect central nervous system output related to stress-sensitive depressive disorder development. Overall design: Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into control, model, fluoxetine and acupuncture groups. The rat model of depression was established by subjecting to chronic restraint stress (6h/day) for 28 days. Rats in acupuncture group were acupunctured at GV20 (Baihui) and GV29 (Yintang) one hour before the CRS procedures every day. Rats in fluoxetine group were administered with fluoxetine (10mg/kg) by gavage one hour before the CRS procedures every day. Open-field test, Sucrose preference and body weight were investigated respectively at the experiment before and after the experiment. The experiment having been finished, the hippocampal, frontal cortex and pituitary gland were harvested, and their RNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using  Illumina Nextseq 500/151nt.",

Results: Based on the data from RNA-seq analysis, it revealed that compared the expression of genes in the control group with model group in the respective of three brain tissues, 101, 134, 148 differential expression genes were found in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and pituitary gland, respectively; compared the expression of genes in the fluoxetine group with model group in the respective of three brain tissues, 41, 46, 87 differential expression genes were found in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and pituitary gland, respectively; compared the expression of genes in the acupuncture group with model group in the respective of three brain tissues, 107, 89, 179 differential expression genes were found in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and pituitary gland, respectively. Furthermore, we used the GO (Gene ontology) analysis and KEGG (Kyo-To conservation of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis for these differentially expressed genes. We found that the results of these two analyses were consistent, both mainly related to monoamine neurotransmitters, inflammation and immune response in control group VS model group. It is noted that this phenomenon also appears in fluoxetine group compared  with model group, acupuncture group VS model group. Importantly, the antidepressant effect of acupuncture was more extensive, which was more consistent with the pathogenesis of depression induced by CRS in rats. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of the hippocampal, frontal cortex and pituitary gland  genome-wide transcriptomes in depression rats under CRS by RNA-seq technology. The results of this study revealed multiple DEGs and possible mechanisms specifying the function of hippocampal, frontal cortex and pituitary gland in depression rats induced by CRS. These results provide a basis for further investigation of the signaling mechanisms that affect central nervous system output related to stress-sensitive depressive disorder development. Overall design: Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into control, model, fluoxetine and acupuncture groups. The rat model of depression was established by subjecting to chronic restraint stress (6h/day) for 28 days. Rats in acupuncture group were acupunctured at GV20 (Baihui) and GV29 (Yintang) one hour before the CRS procedures every day. Rats in fluoxetine group were administered with fluoxetine (10mg/kg) by gavage one hour before the CRS procedures every day. Open-field test, Sucrose preference and body weight were investigated respectively at the experiment before and after the experiment. The experiment having been finished, the hippocampal, frontal cortex and pituitary gland were harvested, and their RNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using  Illumina Nextseq 500/151nt.",

                    "abstract": "Depression and anxiety disorders are more prevalent in females, but the majority of research in animal models, the first step in finding new treatments, has focused predominantly on males. Here we report that exposure to subchronic variable stress (SCVS) induces depression-associated behaviors in female mice, whereas males are resilient as they do not develop these behavioral abnormalities. In concert with these different behavioral responses, transcriptional analysis of nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain reward region, by use of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed markedly different patterns of stress regulation of gene expression between the sexes. Among the genes displaying sex differences was DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a), which shows a greater induction in females after SCVS. Interestingly, Dnmt3a expression levels were increased in the NAc of depressed humans, an effect seen in both males and females. Local overexpression of Dnmt3a in NAc rendered male mice more susceptible to SCVS, whereas Dnmt3a knock-out in this region rendered females more resilient, directly implicating this gene in stress responses. Associated with this enhanced resilience of female mice upon NAc knock-out of Dnmt3a was a partial shift of the NAc female transcriptome toward the male pattern after SCVS. These data indicate that males and females undergo different patterns of transcriptional regulation in response to stress and that a DNA methyltransferase in NAc contributes to sex differences in stress vulnerability. Overall design: mRNA profiles of sex-specific in stress response were generated in the Nucleus Accumbens for 3 female control mice, 3 male control mice, 3 stressed female mice, 3 stressed male mice. Cre-mediated Dnmt3a knock-out was performed on stressed mice, with 3 males and 3 females expressing control GFP and 3 males and 3 females expressing CRE/GFP.",

Here we report that exposure to subchronic variable stress (SCVS) induces depression-associated behaviors in female mice, whereas males are resilient as they do not develop these behavioral abnormalities. In concert with these different behavioral responses, transcriptional analysis of nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain reward region, by use of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed markedly different patterns of stress regulation of gene expression between the sexes. Among the genes displaying sex differences was DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a), which shows a greater induction in females after SCVS. Interestingly, Dnmt3a expression levels were increased in the NAc of depressed humans, an effect seen in both males and females. Local overexpression of Dnmt3a in NAc rendered male mice more susceptible to SCVS, whereas Dnmt3a knock-out in this region rendered females more resilient, directly implicating this gene in stress responses. Associated with this enhanced resilience of female mice upon NAc knock-out of Dnmt3a was a partial shift of the NAc female transcriptome toward the male pattern after SCVS. These data indicate that males and females undergo different patterns of transcriptional regulation in response to stress and that a DNA methyltransferase in NAc contributes to sex differences in stress vulnerability.

Here we report that exposure to subchronic variable stress (SCVS) induces depression-associated behaviors in female mice, whereas males are resilient as they do not develop these behavioral abnormalities. In concert with these different behavioral responses, transcriptional analysis of nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain reward region, by use of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed markedly different patterns of stress regulation of gene expression between the sexes. Among the genes displaying sex differences was DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a), which shows a greater induction in females after SCVS. Interestingly, Dnmt3a expression levels were increased in the NAc of depressed humans, an effect seen in both males and females. Local overexpression of Dnmt3a in NAc rendered male mice more susceptible to SCVS, whereas Dnmt3a knock-out in this region rendered females more resilient, directly implicating this gene in stress responses. Associated with this enhanced resilience of female mice upon NAc knock-out of Dnmt3a was a partial shift of the NAc female transcriptome toward the male pattern after SCVS. These data indicate that males and females undergo different patterns of transcriptional regulation in response to stress and that a DNA methyltransferase in NAc contributes to sex differences in stress vulnerability. Overall design: mRNA profiles of sex-specific in stress response were generated in the Nucleus Accumbens for 3 female control mice, 3 male control mice, 3 stressed female mice, 3 stressed male mice.

                    "abstract": "Depression and anxiety disorders are more prevalent in females, but the majority of research in animal models, the first step in finding new treatments, has focused predominantly on males. Here we report that exposure to subchronic variable stress (SCVS) induces depression-associated behaviors in female mice, whereas males are resilient as they do not develop these behavioral abnormalities. In concert with these different behavioral responses, transcriptional analysis of nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain reward region, by use of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed markedly different patterns of stress regulation of gene expression between the sexes. Among the genes displaying sex differences was DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a), which shows a greater induction in females after SCVS. Interestingly, Dnmt3a expression levels were increased in the NAc of depressed humans, an effect seen in both males and females. Local overexpression of Dnmt3a in NAc rendered male mice more susceptible to SCVS, whereas Dnmt3a knock-out in this region rendered females more resilient, directly implicating this gene in stress responses. Associated with this enhanced resilience of female mice upon NAc knock-out of Dnmt3a was a partial shift of the NAc female transcriptome toward the male pattern after SCVS. These data indicate that males and females undergo different patterns of transcriptional regulation in response to stress and that a DNA methyltransferase in NAc contributes to sex differences in stress vulnerability. Overall design: mRNA profiles of sex-specific in stress response were generated in the Nucleus Accumbens for 3 female control mice, 3 male control mice, 3 stressed female mice, 3 stressed male mice. Cre-mediated Dnmt3a knock-out was performed on stressed mice, with 3 males and 3 females expressing control GFP and 3 males and 3 females expressing CRE/GFP.",

Chronic defeat stress induces a depression-like state in mice, which is similar to depressive states in humans according to similarities in symptoms, etiology, and sensitivity to antidepressants and anxiolytics as well as cerebral neurochemical changes. We analyzed the effects of social defeat stress of varying duration (10 and 30 days) on the behavioral patterns and prefrontal-cortex transcriptome (RNA-seq) in C57BL/6 mice. Commonly used 10-day exposure to social defeat stress resulted in a high level of social avoidance with no sign of depression-associated behavior. Contrariwise, most animals exposed to 30-day stress demonstrated clear hallmarks of depression, including higher level of social avoidance, increased immobility in the forced swim test, and anhedonic behavior. The monitoring of transcriptome changes revealed massive alterations in gene expression on the 10th day. Surprisingly, expression of a few genes was only affected on the 30th day of stress, apparently, due to a reversal of the majority of the early stress-induced changes to the original basal state. Moreover, we have found that glucocorticoid-sensitive genes are clearly enriched targets on the 10th day of stress, but these genes stop responding to the elevated corticosterone level after the 30th day of stress. The majority of genes altered by 30-day stress were downregulated, with the most relevant ones participating in chromatin-modifications and neuroplasticity (e,g, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) of Rho-family GTPases). Very different molecular responses occur in both short-term and long-term social stress. Early-stress response associates with social avoidance and with up- and down- regulation of many genes, including signal transduction and cell adhesion pathways. Downregulation of a few genes, in particular, histone -modifying methyltransferases, is a signature of response to prolonged stress that induces depression. Altogether, our data show that the development of depression under social stress conditions is correlated with suppression of the overactivity of molecular response to induced stress, involving gene regulation resistance to corticoid molecules, potentially via chromatin remodeling mechanism.",

                    "abstract": "The project is directed to investigation of the gene activity dynamics during the development of a depression-like state. Chronic defeat stress induces a depression-like state in mice, which is similar to depressive states in humans according to similarities in symptoms, etiology, and sensitivity to antidepressants and anxiolytics as well as cerebral neurochemical changes. We analyzed the effects of social defeat stress of varying duration (10 and 30 days) on the behavioral patterns and prefrontal-cortex transcriptome (RNA-seq) in C57BL/6 mice. Commonly used 10-day exposure to social defeat stress resulted in a high level of social avoidance with no sign of depression-associated behavior. Contrariwise, most animals exposed to 30-day stress demonstrated clear hallmarks of depression, including higher level of social avoidance, increased immobility in the forced swim test, and anhedonic behavior. The monitoring of transcriptome changes revealed massive alterations in gene expression on the 10th day. Surprisingly, expression of a few genes was only affected on the 30th day of stress, apparently, due to a reversal of the majority of the early stress-induced changes to the original basal state. Moreover, we have found that glucocorticoid-sensitive genes are clearly enriched targets on the 10th day of stress, but these genes stop responding to the elevated corticosterone level after the 30th day of stress. The majority of genes altered by 30-day stress were downregulated, with the most relevant ones participating in chromatin-modifications and neuroplasticity (e,g, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) of Rho-family GTPases). Very different molecular responses occur in both short-term and long-term social stress. Early-stress response associates with social avoidance and with up- and down- regulation of many genes, including signal transduction and cell adhesion pathways. Downregulation of a few genes, in particular, histone -modifying methyltransferases, is a signature of response to prolonged stress that induces depression. Altogether, our data show that the development of depression under social stress conditions is correlated with suppression of the overactivity of molecular response to induced stress, involving gene regulation resistance to corticoid molecules, potentially via chromatin remodeling mechanism.",

                    "abstract": "The project is directed to investigation of the gene activity dynamics during the development of a depression-like state. Chronic defeat stress induces a depression-like state in mice, which is similar to depressive states in humans according to similarities in symptoms, etiology, and sensitivity to antidepressants and anxiolytics as well as cerebral neurochemical changes. We analyzed the effects of social defeat stress of varying duration (10 and 30 days) on the behavioral patterns and prefrontal-cortex transcriptome (RNA-seq) in C57BL/6 mice. Commonly used 10-day exposure to social defeat stress resulted in a high level of social avoidance with no sign of depression-associated behavior. Contrariwise, most animals exposed to 30-day stress demonstrated clear hallmarks of depression, including higher level of social avoidance, increased immobility in the forced swim test, and anhedonic behavior. The monitoring of transcriptome changes revealed massive alterations in gene expression on the 10th day. Surprisingly, expression of a few genes was only affected on the 30th day of stress, apparently, due to a reversal of the majority of the early stress-induced changes to the original basal state. Moreover, we have found that glucocorticoid-sensitive genes are clearly enriched targets on the 10th day of stress, but these genes stop responding to the elevated corticosterone level after the 30th day of stress. The majority of genes altered by 30-day stress were downregulated, with the most relevant ones participating in chromatin-modifications and neuroplasticity (e,g, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) of Rho-family GTPases). Very different molecular responses occur in both short-term and long-term social stress. Early-stress response associates with social avoidance and with up- and down- regulation of many genes, including signal transduction and cell adhesion pathways. Downregulation of a few genes, in particular, histone -modifying methyltransferases, is a signature of response to prolonged stress that induces depression. Altogether, our data show that the development of depression under social stress conditions is correlated with suppression of the overactivity of molecular response to induced stress, involving gene regulation resistance to corticoid molecules, potentially via chromatin remodeling mechanism.",

Further, given the heterogeneity of treatment response in human populations, examining both treatment response and non-response is critical. Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine.

Further, given the heterogeneity of treatment response in human populations, examining both treatment response and non-response is critical. Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine. Overall design: mRNA profiles of susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress as well as treatment response were generated across 4 separate brain regions, with a sample size of 3-5 per group.",

Further, given the heterogeneity of treatment response in human populations, examining both treatment response and non-response is critical. Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine. Overall design: mRNA profiles of susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress as well as treatment response were generated across 4 separate brain regions, with a sample size of 3-5 per group.",

Further, given the heterogeneity of treatment response in human populations, examining both treatment response and non-response is critical. Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine. Overall design: mRNA profiles of susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress as well as treatment response were generated across 4 separate brain regions, with a sample size of 3-5 per group.",

Further, given the heterogeneity of treatment response in human populations, examining both treatment response and non-response is critical. Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine. Overall design: mRNA profiles of susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress as well as treatment response were generated across 4 separate brain regions, with a sample size of 3-5 per group.",

Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine. Overall design: mRNA profiles of susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress as well as treatment response were generated across 4 separate brain regions, with a sample size of 3-5 per group.",

Further, given the heterogeneity of treatment response in human populations, examining both treatment response and non-response is critical. Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine. Overall design: mRNA profiles of susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress as well as treatment response were generated across 4 separate brain regions, with a sample size of 3-5 per group.",

Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine. Overall design: mRNA profiles of susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress as well as treatment response were generated across 4 separate brain regions, with a sample size of 3-5 per group.",

Further, given the heterogeneity of treatment response in human populations, examining both treatment response and non-response is critical. Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine. Overall design: mRNA profiles of susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress as well as treatment response were generated across 4 separate brain regions, with a sample size of 3-5 per group.",

Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine. Overall design: mRNA profiles of susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress as well as treatment response were generated across 4 separate brain regions, with a sample size of 3-5 per group.",

                    "abstract": "We used an established chemical labeling and affinity purification method coupled with high-throughput sequencing technology to generate the first genome-wide profile of hippocampal 5hmC following exposure to acute restraint stress and a one-hour recovery. This approach found a genome-wide disruption in 5hmC associated with acute stress response, primarily in genic regions, and identified known and potentially novel stress-related targets that have a significant enrichment for neuronal ontological functions. Integration of these data with hippocampal gene expression data from these same mice found stress-related hydroxymethylation correlated to altered transcript levels and sequence motif predictions indicated that 5hmC may function by mediating transcription factor binding to these transcripts. Together, these data reveal an environmental impact on this newly discovered epigenetic mark in the brain and represent a critical step toward understanding stress-related epigenetic mechanisms that alter gene expression and can lead to the development of psychiatric disorders. Overall design: Examined the effect of a 30 minutes acute stress on hippocampal 5hmC profile of adult C57BL/6J background male mice.",

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression.

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice.

We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression.

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice.

We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression. However, emerging evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that dysregulated circuit function and gene expression across multiple brain regions drive depressive phenotypes. Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice.

Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery.

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression.

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery.

Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression.

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery.

Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression.

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice.

Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression.

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice.

Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression.

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice.

Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression.

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice.

Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression.

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice.

Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat.

Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery.

Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression.

Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice.

Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice.

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and individual genes that contribute to depression. However, emerging evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that dysregulated circuit function and gene expression across multiple brain regions drive depressive phenotypes. Here we use a bioinformatics approach intersecting differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms in mice. We performed RNA-sequencing on multiple brain regions from control animals and those either susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at multiple time points after defeat. We bioinformatically identified several transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility, and in vivo manipulations of these networks confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our findings reveal novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offer fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery. Overall design: RNA-seq samples were generated from 4 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and ventral hippocampus (VHIP) ) at 3 time-points (48h, 28d, 28d +1h stress) after chronic social defeat stress in control, susceptible and resilient mice. Additionally, RNA-seq samples were generated from virally infected VHIP tissue (HSV-GFP or HSV-Dkkl1) after an accelerated social defeat to assess the effect of Dkkl1 over-expression.",

We here employed ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing to quantify the translational status and transcript levels in mouse hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning. We identified 104 genes that are dynamically regulated. Intriguingly, our analysis revealed novel repressive regulations in the hippocampus: translational suppression of ribosomal protein-coding genes at basal state; learning-induced early translational repression of specific genes; and late persistent suppression of a subset of genes via inhibition of ESR1/ERa signaling. Further behavioral analyses revealed that Nrsn1, one of the newly identified genes undergoing rapid translational repression, can act as a memory suppressor gene. This study unveils the yet unappreciated importance of gene repression mechanisms in memory formation. Overall design: The application of ribosome profiling and RNA-seq techniques to mouse hippocampi tissues after contextual fear conditioning and to mouse hippocampal primary cultures.  Mouse ESCs were also examined.",

Intriguingly, our analysis revealed novel repressive regulations in the hippocampus: translational suppression of ribosomal protein-coding genes at basal state; learning-induced early translational repression of specific genes; and late persistent suppression of a subset of genes via inhibition of ESR1/ERa signaling. Further behavioral analyses revealed that Nrsn1, one of the newly identified genes undergoing rapid translational repression, can act as a memory suppressor gene. This study unveils the yet unappreciated importance of gene repression mechanisms in memory formation. Overall design: The application of ribosome profiling and RNA-seq techniques to mouse hippocampi tissues after contextual fear conditioning and to mouse hippocampal primary cultures.  Mouse ESCs were also examined.",
