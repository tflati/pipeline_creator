Here, we identify TSHZ3 as the critical region for a syndrome associated with heterozygous deletions at 19q12q13.11, which includes autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In Tshz3 null mice, differentially expressed genes include layer-specific markers of cerebral cortical projection neurons (CPNs) and their human orthologues are strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, heterozygous Tshz3-deficient mice show functional changes at synapses established by CPNs and exhibit core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. These findings reveal essential roles for Tshz3 in CPN development and function, whose alterations can account for ASD in the newly-defined TSHZ3 deletion syndrome. Overall design: Three independent replicates, each containing cortices from 3-4 embryos from multiple litters, were prepared from wild-type and Tshz3 mutant neocortex at E18.5.

Here, we identify TSHZ3 as the critical region for a syndrome associated with heterozygous deletions at 19q12q13.11, which includes autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In Tshz3 null mice, differentially expressed genes include layer-specific markers of cerebral cortical projection neurons (CPNs) and their human orthologues are strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, heterozygous Tshz3-deficient mice show functional changes at synapses established by CPNs and exhibit core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. These findings reveal essential roles for Tshz3 in CPN development and function, whose alterations can account for ASD in the newly-defined TSHZ3 deletion syndrome. Overall design: Three independent replicates, each containing cortices from 3-4 embryos from multiple litters, were prepared from wild-type and Tshz3 mutant neocortex at E18.5.

We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone, and fenamidone, produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease).

We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone, and fenamidone, produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease).

We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone, and fenamidone, produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease).

We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone, and fenamidone, produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease).

We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone, and fenamidone, produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease).

We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone, and fenamidone, produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease).

We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone, and fenamidone, produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease).

Here, we sought to prospectively identify chemicals that share transcriptomic signatures with neurological disorders by exposing mouse cortical neuron-enriched cultures to hundreds of chemicals commonly found in the environment and on food.  We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone, and fenamidone, produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease).  These chemicals stimulate free radical production and disrupt microtubules in neurons, effects that can be reduced by pretreating with a microtubule stabilizer, an antioxidant, or with sulforaphane.  Our study provides an approach to prospectively identify environmental chemicals that transcriptionally mimic autism and other brain disorders. Overall design: 405 total samples, consisting of 297 unique chemicals and vehicle controls.",

We used Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated mGlu1/5-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD). In these neurons, we find the Chrm4 transcript encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) is excessively translated, and synthesis of M4 downstream of mGlu5 activation is mimicked and occluded. Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 activity normalizes core phenotypes in the Fmr1-/y, including excessive protein synthesis, exaggerated mGluR-LTD, and audiogenic seizures. These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain. Overall design: 6 biological replicates of total hippocampal mRNA (Input) from WT and Fmr1 KO littermate pairs and CA1-TRAP-IP (IP) from the same 6 WT and KO littermate pairs.",

We used Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated mGlu1/5-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD). In these neurons, we find the Chrm4 transcript encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) is excessively translated, and synthesis of M4 downstream of mGlu5 activation is mimicked and occluded. Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 activity normalizes core phenotypes in the Fmr1-/y, including excessive protein synthesis, exaggerated mGluR-LTD, and audiogenic seizures. These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain.

We used Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated mGlu1/5-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD). In these neurons, we find the Chrm4 transcript encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) is excessively translated, and synthesis of M4 downstream of mGlu5 activation is mimicked and occluded. Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 activity normalizes core phenotypes in the Fmr1-/y, including excessive protein synthesis, exaggerated mGluR-LTD, and audiogenic seizures. These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain.

Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 activity normalizes core phenotypes in the Fmr1-/y, including excessive protein synthesis, exaggerated mGluR-LTD, and audiogenic seizures. These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain. Overall design: 6 biological replicates of total hippocampal mRNA (Input) from WT and Fmr1 KO littermate pairs and CA1-TRAP-IP (IP) from the same 6 WT and KO littermate pairs.",

We used Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated mGlu1/5-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD). In these neurons, we find the Chrm4 transcript encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) is excessively translated, and synthesis of M4 downstream of mGlu5 activation is mimicked and occluded.

These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain.

We used Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated mGlu1/5-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD). In these neurons, we find the Chrm4 transcript encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) is excessively translated, and synthesis of M4 downstream of mGlu5 activation is mimicked and occluded. Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 activity normalizes core phenotypes in the Fmr1-/y, including excessive protein synthesis, exaggerated mGluR-LTD, and audiogenic seizures. These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain.

We used Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated mGlu1/5-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD). In these neurons, we find the Chrm4 transcript encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) is excessively translated, and synthesis of M4 downstream of mGlu5 activation is mimicked and occluded. Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 activity normalizes core phenotypes in the Fmr1-/y, including excessive protein synthesis, exaggerated mGluR-LTD, and audiogenic seizures. These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain.

We used Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated mGlu1/5-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD).

These results suggest that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain.
