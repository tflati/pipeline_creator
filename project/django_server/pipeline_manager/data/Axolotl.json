In this study, we performed RNA-seq on regenerating hearts from three model organisms - axolotl, zebrafish and mouse. Apical resection was performed to amputate ~10 - 20% of the left ventricle in all three model organisms. Following resection, hearts were harvested at 12, 24 and 48 hours post-resection and subjected to RNA-seq. RNA-seq on sham controls (no ventricular amputation) was used as interanal control. This approach revealed upregulation of inflammatory genes in all three organisms during regeneration. Furthermore, upregulation of Complement 5a receptor1 (C5aR1) expression in the regenerating hearts of zebrafish, axolotls and mice was observed. Overall design: Examination of differentially expressed genes in early cardiac regeneration in three model organisms - zebrafish, axolotl and mouse.",

Courtship behavior in urodele amphibians often includes female exposure to secretions from the cloacal gland, as well as other scent glands. The first vertebrate proteinaceous pheromone discovered, the decapeptide sodefrin, is a female attracting pheromone secreted by the cloacal gland of male Cynops pyrrhogaster. Other proteinaceous pheromones in salamanders have been shown to elicit responses from females towards conspecific males. The presence and levels of expression of proteinaceous pheromones have not been identified in the family Ambystomatidae, which includes several important research models. The objective of this research was therefore to identify putative proteinaceous pheromones from male axolotls, Ambystoma mexicanum, as well as their relative expression levels. The results indicate that axolotls possess two different forms of sodefrin precursor-like factor (alpha and beta), as well as a putative ortholog of plethodontid modulating factor. The beta form of sodefrin precursor-like factor was amongst the most highly expressed transcripts within the cloacal gland. The ortholog of plethodontid modulating factor was expressed at a level equivalent to the beta sodefrin precursor-like factor. The presence of these highly expressed proteinaceous pheromones may indicate that male axolotls use multiple chemical cues to attract female conspecifics. Behavioral assays would indicate whether the putative protein pheromones elicit courtship activity from female axolotls.",
