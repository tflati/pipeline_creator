A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",

A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",

A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",

A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",

A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",

A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",

A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",

A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",

A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",

A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",

A greater and a prolonged transcriptional response after irradiation was induced in the RS cell line. Functional analysis showed that 24 h after irradiation genes involved in DNA damage response, negative regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis were still differentially up-regulated in the RS cell line but not in the RR cell line. Overall design: Sham-irradiated and irradiated (2 Gy) cell cultures of the RS and the RR cell line were incubated at 37\u00baC for 4 and 24 h and 14 days. After that, RNA was extracted and sequenced with QuantSeq technology",
