Here, we have sequenced the genome of H. dujardini using single individual Illumina DNA-Seq data and PacBio long read data, and employed a heterozygosity aware assembly method to assemble a near-complete high quality genome. In order to annotate the genome with gene predictions, we conducted RNA-Sequencing of various stages of developmental, juvenile, adult, and anhydrobiotic stage H. dujardini and Ramazzottius varieornatus, a tardigrade capable of rapid anhydrobiosis entry, and used these data for gene prediction with BRAKER v1.9 or differential gene expression analysis of the active and anhydrobiotic stages. Overall design: We obtained RNA-Seq data for the developmental, juvenile, active, and Tun stages of Hypsibius dujardini and Ramazzottius varieornatus, N=3 for each sample.",

The anhydrobiotic tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini, is a non-pigmented tardigrade easy to culture and RNAi method have been established, therefore making it a model tardigrade for tardigrade molecular research. Previous genome assemblies of this tardigrade had increased size due to heterozygosity. Here, we have sequenced the genome of H. dujardini using single individual Illumina DNA-Seq data and PacBio long read data, and employed a heterozygosity aware assembly method to assemble a near-complete high quality genome. In order to annotate the genome with gene predictions, we conducted RNA-Sequencing of various stages of developmental, juvenile, adult, and anhydrobiotic stage H. dujardini and Ramazzottius varieornatus, a tardigrade capable of rapid anhydrobiosis entry, and used these data for gene prediction with BRAKER v1.9 or differential gene expression analysis of the active and anhydrobiotic stages. Overall design: We obtained RNA-Seq data for the developmental, juvenile, active, and Tun stages of Hypsibius dujardini and Ramazzottius varieornatus, N=3 for each sample.",

This \u201cphylotypic stage\u201d has recently received support from transcriptome analyses, which have also detected similar stages in nematodes and arthropods. A conserved stage in these three phyla has led us to ask if all animals pass through a universal definitive stage as a consequence of ancestral constraints on animal development. Previous work has suggested that HOX genes may comprise such a \u2018zootypic\u2019 stage, however this hypothetical stage has hitherto resisted systematic analysis. We have examined the embryonic development of ten different animals each of a fundamentally different phylum, including a segmented worm, a flatworm, a roundworm, a water bear, a fruitfly, a sea urchin, a zebrafish, a sea anemone, a sponge, and a comb jelly. For each species, we collected the embryonic transcriptomes at ~100 different developmental stages and analyzed their gene expression profiles. We found dynamic gene expression across all of the species that is structured in a stage like manner. Strikingly, we found that animal embryology contains two dominant modules of zygotic expression in terms of their protein domain composition: one involving proliferation, and a second involving differentiation. The switch between these two modules involves induction of the zootype; which in addition to homeobox containing genes, also involves Wnt and Notch signaling as well as forkhead domain transcription factors. Our results provide a systematic characterization of animal universality and identify the points of embryological constraints and flexibility. Overall design: 126 single embryo samples.",

For each species, we collected the embryonic transcriptomes at ~100 different developmental stages and analyzed their gene expression profiles. We found dynamic gene expression across all of the species that is structured in a stage like manner. Strikingly, we found that animal embryology contains two dominant modules of zygotic expression in terms of their protein domain composition: one involving proliferation, and a second involving differentiation. The switch between these two modules involves induction of the zootype; which in addition to homeobox containing genes, also involves Wnt and Notch signaling as well as forkhead domain transcription factors. Our results provide a systematic characterization of animal universality and identify the points of embryological constraints and flexibility. Overall design: 126 single embryo samples.",

Previous work has suggested that HOX genes may comprise such a \u2018zootypic\u2019 stage, however this hypothetical stage has hitherto resisted systematic analysis. We have examined the embryonic development of ten different animals each of a fundamentally different phylum, including a segmented worm, a flatworm, a roundworm, a water bear, a fruitfly, a sea urchin, a zebrafish, a sea anemone, a sponge, and a comb jelly. For each species, we collected the embryonic transcriptomes at ~100 different developmental stages and analyzed their gene expression profiles. We found dynamic gene expression across all of the species that is structured in a stage like manner. Strikingly, we found that animal embryology contains two dominant modules of zygotic expression in terms of their protein domain composition: one involving proliferation, and a second involving differentiation. The switch between these two modules involves induction of the zootype; which in addition to homeobox containing genes, also involves Wnt and Notch signaling as well as forkhead domain transcription factors. Our results provide a systematic characterization of animal universality and identify the points of embryological constraints and flexibility. Overall design: 126 single embryo samples.",
