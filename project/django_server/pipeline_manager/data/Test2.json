In mice, deletion of Slc7a5 from the endothelial cells of the BBB leads to decreased levels of brain BCAAs, abnormal mRNA translation and severe neurological abnormalities. Furthermore, we identified several patients with autistic traits and motor delay carrying deleterious homozygous mutations in the SLC7A5 gene. Finally, we demonstrate that BCAA intracerebroventricular administration ameliorates abnormal behaviors in adult mutant mice.

We previously described abnormalities in the branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic pathway as a cause of ASD. Here we show that the solute carrier transporter 7a5 (SLC7A5), a large neutral amino acid transporter localized at the blood brain barrier (BBB), has an essential role in maintaining normal levels of brain BCAAs. In mice, deletion of Slc7a5 from the endothelial cells of the BBB leads to decreased levels of brain BCAAs, abnormal mRNA translation and severe neurological abnormalities. Furthermore, we identified several patients with autistic traits and motor delay carrying deleterious homozygous mutations in the SLC7A5 gene. Finally, we demonstrate that BCAA intracerebroventricular administration ameliorates abnormal behaviors in adult mutant mice. Our data elucidate a neurological syndrome defined by SLC7A5 mutations and support an essential role for the BCAA in human brain function.

These analyses revealed that the loss of MeCP2 results in aberrant global pattern of gene expression, characterized predominantly by higher levels of expression of activity-dependent genes, and anomalous alternative splicing events, specifically in response to neuronal activity. Overall design: For in vitro experiments, RNA-seq was performed on MeCP2-null (MT) and wild-type (WT) neuron-enriched cortical cultures that were either treated (T) with KCl for 3hr or not treated (N), after 10 days in culture. For in vivo experiments, RNA-seq was performed on hippocampi of MeCP2-null (MT) and wild-type (WT) mice that were either treated with kainic acid for 40 or 68 minutes, or not treated.",
